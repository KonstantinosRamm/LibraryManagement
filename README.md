# LibraryManagement

## This project focuses on developing a Library Management System to practice and enhance my knowledge of data structures, particularly hash tables. The system implements the Cuckoo Hashing algorithm for efficient storage and management of books. Additionally, the project aims to improve my design skills using UML, serving as a personal reference for tracking books I’ve read. Although I could easily use ready-made data structures from the STL, I’ve chosen to implement them myself in order to deepen my understanding and further refine my skills.

# Key Features

##
- Efficient Book Management: Utilize Cuckoo Hashing to ensure fast insertion, deletion, and search operations for managing book records.
- Track Books Read: Maintain a record of books you've read, including metadata such as title, author, and genre.
- UML Design: The system design is represented through UML diagrams, helping to improve skills in designing clear and structured system architectures.
- Implement Features such as : sorting the books based on a field like ISBN,Title,Author
- Use of Multiple Hash Tables for search By Multiple Fields
- Technologes: C++,Uml
