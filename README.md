# LibraryManagement

## This project focuses on developing a Library Management System to practice and enhance knowledge of data structures, with a particular emphasis on hash tables. The system implements the Cuckoo Hashing algorithm for efficient storage and management of books. Additionally, this project aims to improve designing with UML, providing a personal reference for tracking books that have been read.
